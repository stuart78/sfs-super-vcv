# Static analysis, the way the VCV Library runs it.
#
# THE LIBRARY RUNS TWO CHECKERS, cppcheck AND clang-tidy. This script ran only
# cppcheck, which is how 2.18.0 shipped with fourteen clang-tidy findings in it
# (issue #12) after we had declared static analysis clean. cppcheck agreed with
# us exactly -- the gap was never a disagreement, it was a checker we simply
# never ran. If you add a checker to the pipeline, add it here first.
#
# Running these before submitting means finding our own bugs instead of being
# told about them, and it has earned that twice: cppcheck caught Fill importing
# a bank with an uninitialised taste struct and a read one past the end of the
# Hann table (issue #11), and clang-tidy caught a file-read loop that treated a
# disk error as end-of-file and imported the truncated result (issue #12).
#
# Copied from Signal Function Set. Its filters for vendored sources (dr_wav,
# dr_flac, miniz, src/msfa) are kept; they match nothing here yet.
#
# Exit status is the number of findings in our own code, so this can gate a
# release: `./tools/static-check.sh && ./build.sh prod`.
