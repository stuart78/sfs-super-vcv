// Modal synthesis of a struck circular membrane, for Kit.
//
// A drum head is a 2D wave equation on a disc, and its solutions are the Bessel
// modes J_m(j_mn * r/R) * cos(m*theta). Rather than run a mesh over the disc,
// this bank runs one resonator per mode. That is cheaper, and much more
// importantly it puts every parameter you would want to play in plain sight:
// strike position becomes a per-mode gain you can evaluate in closed form, and
// muffling becomes the same evaluation used subtractively.
//
// THE ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT THE PARAMETERS. For an ideal membrane
// f = (c / 2*pi*R) * j_mn with c = sqrt(T/sigma), so radius and tension scale
// every mode by the same factor and leave the RATIOS untouched. Size and
// tightness are therefore the same control, acoustically, and shipping both as
// separate knobs would be shipping a duplicate. What breaks the scale
// invariance -- and so what makes a small tight drum sound different from a
// large slack one at the same pitch -- is bending stiffness, the air cavity and
// size-dependent damping. Those are not decoration here; they are the reason
// SIZE is allowed to exist.

	// J_m(j_mn * r_mic) * cos(m * (theta_mic - theta_strike)), the same closed
	// form the strike and the muffle already use.
	//
	// It is also the first thing here that makes the strike ANGLE audible. A
	// disc is rotationally symmetric, so with ONE listening point the angle
	// cannot matter and only the radius is a tone control (see the note above
	// Drum). A second point breaks the symmetry, so in stereo mode moving the
	// strike round the head sweeps the image -- with no panner anywhere.
	//
	// NOT MIRRORED, deliberately, and this is the whole of why the positions
	// look arbitrary. cos(m * dtheta) is EVEN, so a pair mirrored about some
	// axis returns exactly the same signal at both taps for any strike ON that
	// axis -- and Kit's default strike is straight up the head. A tidy mirrored
	// pair would therefore put the factory patch on the one line where stereo
	// mode collapses to mono. Asymmetric in angle AND radius, the only place the
	// two channels agree is the dead centre, where the strike really is
	// rotationally symmetric and mono really is the right answer.
	// BOTH AT THE SAME RADIUS, which is not tidiness. An m = 0 mode is a
	// monopole: it has no angular shape, so it reads IDENTICALLY at every point
	// on the head and no placement can ever decorrelate it. Two taps at
	// different radii therefore do not separate the monopoles, they only make
	// one channel louder than the other -- measured at 2.8 dB of permanent
	// lean, for nothing. Equal radii, and every difference between the channels
	// is angular.
	//
	// And the monopoles are most of the sound: measured over the ten
	// instruments, 69-93% of the energy sits at m = 0, so the head alone is
	// worth about -12 dB of side, with the fundamental dead centre. That is

	// 150 degrees apart, with the pair's centre line 30 degrees off the default
	// strike. Both halves of that are measurements, not taste (harness mode
	// `grid`): the separation is what sets the width, and it flattens out past
	// about 150; the offset decides where the pair's NULL falls. Two points on
	// a disc always have a perpendicular bisector, and a strike along it is
	// equidistant from both mics AND angularly symmetric between them, so it
	// reads identically at each -- there are always two directions on the head
	// where the drum is dead centre. That is a position like any other, but it
